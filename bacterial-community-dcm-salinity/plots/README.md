# Plots Documentation

This directory contains the visualizations generated during the analysis of bacterial communities in trade wind biomes at the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) under different salinities.

## Overview of Plots

The plots included in this directory illustrate various aspects of the bacterial community structure and diversity in relation to salinity, which is used as a proxy for pH. The visualizations aim to provide insights into how salinity influences bacterial diversity and community composition.

## Types of Plots

1. **Alpha Diversity Plots**: These plots compare the diversity of bacterial communities across different ocean regions and salinity levels. Metrics such as Shannon and Chao1 diversity indices are typically represented.

2. **Ordination Plots**: 
   - **PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis)**: This plot visualizes the relationships between samples based on their bacterial community composition, using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.
   - **NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling)**: Similar to PCoA, NMDS plots provide insights into community structure while emphasizing the ecological distances between samples.

3. **Environmental Fitting Plots**: These plots show the relationship between bacterial community composition and environmental variables, including salinity. Significant environmental vectors are included to highlight their influence on community structure.

4. **Bar Plots of Dominant Bacterial Phyla**: These visualizations display the relative abundance of the top bacterial phyla across different ocean regions, providing a clear comparison of community composition.

## Significance of Plots

The visualizations generated in this project are crucial for understanding the ecological dynamics of bacterial communities in marine environments. By examining how salinity affects community structure, researchers can gain insights into the broader implications of environmental changes on microbial ecosystems.

## Usage

To view the plots, ensure that the analysis has been run successfully, and the plots will be saved in this directory. Each plot file is named according to its content for easy identification.
