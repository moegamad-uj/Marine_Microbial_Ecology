# Load Example Data
To load example data into the working environment, use the data() command:
```{r}
data(GlobalPatterns)
data(esophagus)
data(enterotype)
data(soilrep)
```

# Documentation
In the package index, go to the names beginning with “data-” to see the documentation of currently available example datasets.
```{r}

```
# Run provided examples
You can also try the examples included with the example data documentation (as well as examples for functions/methods) using the standard example command in R – in this case the examples for the enterotype dataset.
